# Cyclistic-Case-Study

Welcome to the Case Study on Cyclistic Bike Share Analysis! This repository contains a thorough investigation of the Chicago-based bike-share startup Cyclistic. I had to figure out how annual members and casual riders use cycling bikes differently for my case study. The objective is to offer expert data visualizations and data-driven insights to assist in the creation of a new marketing plan.
