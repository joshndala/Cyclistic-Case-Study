# Cyclistic-Case-Study

Welcome to the Case Study on Cyclistic Bike Share Analysis! This repository contains a thorough investigation of the Chicago-based bike-share startup Cyclistic. I had to figure out how annual members and casual riders use cycling bikes differently for my case study. The objective is to offer expert data visualizations and data-driven insights to assist in the creation of a new marketing plan.

## About the Case Study

- **Business Task:** How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

- **Data Sources:** This analysis utilizes historical bike trip data provided by Cyclistic.

## Deliverables

1. A clear statement of the business task.
2. A description of data sources.
3. Documentation of data cleaning and manipulation.
4. A summary of the analysis.
5. Supporting visualizations and key findings.
6. Top three recommendations based on the analysis.

## Key Findings

- **User Distribution:** The data reveals a greater number of casual riders compared to annual members, emphasizing the company's goal of increasing the number of members to boost revenue.

- **Weekend vs. Weekday Usage:** Both user groups demonstrate a notable increase in bike usage during the weekends as opposed to weekdays, providing insights for targeted marketing and operational adjustments.
