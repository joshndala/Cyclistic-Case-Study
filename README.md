# Cyclistic-Case-Study

Welcome to the Case Study on Cyclistic Bike Share Analysis! This repository contains a thorough investigation of the Chicago-based bike-share startup Cyclistic. I had to figure out how annual members and casual riders use cycling bikes differently for my case study. The objective is to offer expert data visualizations and data-driven insights to assist in the creation of a new marketing plan.

## About the Case Study

- **Business Task:** How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

- **Data Sources:** This analysis utilizes historical bike trip data between June and September 2023, provided by Cyclistic. It is available in the "Data_zipped" folder.

## Deliverables

1. A clear statement of the business task.
2. Documentation of data cleaning and manipulation.
3. A summary of the analysis.
4. Supporting visualizations and key findings.
5. Top three recommendations based on the analysis.

An R Script can be downloaded ("CyclisticAnalysis.R") to view the documentation.
A PowerPoint presentation can be downloaded ("Cyclistic_Presentation.pptx") to get an overview of the project, as well as the analysis and conclusion.
Data Visualization was done on Tableau, and can be seen here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/joshua.ndala/viz/CaseStudy-CyclisticRideLengthinSummer2023/Sheet1

## Key Findings

- **User Distribution:** The data reveals a greater number of casual riders compared to annual members, emphasizing the company's goal of increasing the number of members to boost revenue.

- **Weekend vs. Weekday Usage:** Both user groups demonstrate a notable increase in bike usage during the weekends as opposed to weekdays, providing insights for targeted marketing and operational adjustments.
